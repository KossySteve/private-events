# private-events
This is the Private-Events project where users are able to create events and choose who to invite based on the Eventbrite model. In this project we practiced a lot the Rails Associations, we also had to use Active Records to make some data queries.

## Restrictions

Only registered and logged in users can create events. They are refered to as *Creators*.


Only registered users can be invited to the event by Creators. They are refered to as *Attendees*
